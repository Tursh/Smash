# Smash

A fighting game in the style of _Super Smash Bros_

## General idea

_Super Smash Bros_ drives the combat out of frame

The general idea is that hitting another player creates __velocity__, that velocity, if too high when hitting the ground, the player dies.

Players, when out of the map, __Loop__ around the map.  

That new mechanic will drive the combat to the center of the map and introduces a new __verticality__
